Basic Configuration for Tarmac
==============================

Introduction
============

  Tarmac gets it's configuration data from ``~/.config/tarmac/tarmac.conf`` --
The configuration is split up by projects.  As an example, Tarmac will
demonstrate its own config throughout this project.  To start with, the Tarmac
project should be added to the config (with the file being created if it
doesn't exist already).::

  [tarmac]
  # Configuration for the Tarmac project


Logging
=======

  The log file, by default, is set to ``~/.config/tarmac/<project-name>``.  In
order to change this location, simply set the log_file setting, as shown
below::

  [tarmac]
  # Configuration for the Tarmac project
  log_file=/path/to/logfile


Cached tree
===========

  Tarmac does its best to only have to fetch the WorkingTree of the trunk
branch once, but sometimes this can have issues.  Tarmac has support for
specifying where a user may have already placed a WorkingTree of the target
branch.  In order to use this, simply set the ``tree_dir`` config setting as
shown below:

  [tarmac]
  # Configuration for the Tarmac project
  tree_dir=/path/to/treedir

  Tarmac is smart enough to clean up that dir when it's done, by making sure
that there are no local changes just hanging around.
