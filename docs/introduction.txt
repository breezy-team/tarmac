Introducing Tarmac
==================

Merging branches is boring.  Really, it is.  After humans have looked over a
merge, it should really just magically be merged.  That's what Tarmac does, and
it does it well.

How it works
============

Tarmac uses Launchpad to manage merging branches.  It does this by checking
over all the branches configured to have Tarmac manage them for merge proposals
that are approved and have commit messages set.  It then merges those branches,
one by one, and automatically commits them.

What's more, Tarmac supports plugins that can prevent a branch from landing if
it doesn't meet specific requirements, or perform specific tasks after the
branch has landed.  This opens up all sorts of branch landing options that can
happen behind the scenes, while you can safely do more exciting work.
