Introduction
============

The Tarmac Launchpad Branch Lander automatically lands branches for a project
hosted on Launchpad after the merges have been properly approved.  It uses the
Launchpad REST API to find approved merge proposals against the current
development focus, and automatically merges those branches.


Installation
============

Download the most recent Tarmac tarball or checkout the branch with ``bzr
branch lp:tarmac``.  Within the tarmac directory, one can run ``tarmac land``
straight from there, or run ``python setup.py install`` to install it to the
system.


Authentication
==============

When running Tarmac for the first time, it will need to get an OAuth token from
Launchpad to allow it to act as a user.  One can do this by running the
following command:

  ``tarmac authenticate``

  ...and then follow the instructions.  The token will be placed in
``$HOME/.config/tarmac/credentials``.  Tarmac does need to write some data, so
it's required that the token have at least write access as the user.


Usage
=====

To land branches with Tarmac, you should run ``tarmac land lp:<branch>``.  For
instance, if I wanted to land all approved merge proposals for lp:tarmac, I'd
run ``tarmac land lp:tarmac``.

Tarmac recognizes branches to land when the merge proposal's status (not the
votes) is "Approved" and a valid commit message has been set for the branch.
If a branch isn't being picked up by Tarmac to land, then one of these issues
is probably the culprit.
