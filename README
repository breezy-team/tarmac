Introduction
============

The Tarmac Launchpad Branch Lander automatically lands branches for a project
hosted on Launchpad after the merges have been properly approved.  It uses the
Launchpad REST API to find approved merge proposals against the current
development focus, and automatically merges those branches.


Installation
============

Download the most recent Tarmac tarball or checkout the branch with ``bzr
branch lp:tarmac``.  Within the tarmac directory, one can run ``tarmac-lander``
straight from there, or run ``python setup.py install`` to install it to the
system.


Authentication
==============

When running Tarmac for the first time, it will need to get an OAuth token from
Launchpad to allow it to act as a user.  One can do this by running the
following command:

  ``tarmac-authenticate``

  ...and then follow the instructions.  The token will be placed in
``$HOME/.config/tarmac/credentials``.  Tarmac does need to write some data, so
it's required that the token have at least write access as the user.


Usage
=====

Run ``tarmac-lander <project>`` to get Tarmac to look for the development
focus of a project and any branches approved to merge into the branch.  One
may test it out without merging by running:

  ``tarmac-lander <project> --dry-run``

Tarmac recognizes branches to land when the merge proposal's status (not the
votes) is "Approved" and a valid commit message has been set for the branch.
If a branch isn't being picked up by Tarmac to land, then one of these issues
is probably the culprit.


Web Interface
=============

Tarmac includes an optional web interface to display the status of Tarmac.
The web interface is a wsgi app that can easily be loaded into mod_wsgi in
your apache or nginx server, or run standalone.
