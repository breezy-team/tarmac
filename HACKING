Writing Tests
=============

  To write tests, there are a few convenience test classes that can be used to
help out.  These test cases can be found in the ``tarmac.tests`` package.
These test cases are:

TarmacTestCase
==============

  Any test written should at least inherit from this test case.  It sets up a
test environment for configuration, etc.  It also makes sure that the test
environment is cleaned up when everything is completed.


TarmacTestCaseWithConfig
========================

  This test case allows one to specify a ``CONFIG_TEMPLATE`` attribute for the
test, and will write that template out to the tarmac config file when
``TarmacTestCaseWithConfig.write_config_file`` is called.
