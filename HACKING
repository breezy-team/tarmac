Writing Tests
=============

  To write tests, there are a few convenience test classes that can be used to
help out.  These test cases can be found in the ``tarmac.tests`` package.
These test cases are:

TarmacTestCase
==============

  Any test written should at least inherit from this test case.  It sets up a
test environment for configuration, etc.  It also makes sure that the test
environment is cleaned up when everything is completed.  Optionally,
TarmacTestCase can have a ``CONFIG_TEMPLATE`` attribute for use with
``TarmacTestCase.write_config_file`` which, when used, will write out a
temporary config file with the contents of the template.
